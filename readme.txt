    Vanilla JavaScript Search App | Wikipedia API
    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dk6Wopar10k&t=4830s

    on Traversy Media, with guest instructor Dave Gray

Using the wikipedia API, we have a search app where all results 
of a search are wikipedia articles. In other words, we are accessing, 
through Wikipedia's API, a pre-existing Wikipedia search app, which
has its built-in method of deciding on relevance of results.

The design imitates the Google search page.

C:\webdev\search-wikipedia-BASIC> contains the tutorial up to 
1 hour 20 minutes plus files grabbed from github so as to get search
results rendering on the page.
